  <p class="left">When flyers touch down in an airport for a layover, they feel stuck. They put their heads between the pages of a book or their eyes onto a screen, and tune out the people around themâ€”people they could be connecting with. This is a fun, cool coincidence, except for when it's a layover. Leet is the answer to that: A webapp that gives users awareness of others who just happen to be in the same place, at the same time.</p>
